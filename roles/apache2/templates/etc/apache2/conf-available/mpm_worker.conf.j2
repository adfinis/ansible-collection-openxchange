# Worker MPM
# ServerLimit			Declares the maximum number of running apache processes. If you change this value you have to restart the daemon.
# StartServers			The number of processes to start initially when starting the apache daemon.
# Min/MaxSpareThreads		This regulates how many threads may stay idle without being killed. Apache regulates this on its own very well with default values.
# ThreadsPerChild		How many threads can be created per process. Can be changed during a reload.
# ThreadLimit			ThreadsPerChild can be configured as high as this value during runtime. If you change this value you have to restart the daemon.
# MaxRequestWorkers		This declares how many concurrent connections we provide. Devided by ThreadsPerChild you get the suitable ServerLimit value.
# 				May be less than ServerLimit * ThreadsPerChild to reserve some resources that can be engaged during runtime with increasing
# 				MaxRequestWorkers and reloading the configuration.
# MaxConnectionsPerChild	Defines the number of Connections that a process can handle during its lifetime (keep-alives are counted once). After that it
# 				will be killed. This can be used to prevent possible apache memory leaks. If set to 0 the lifetime is infinite.
